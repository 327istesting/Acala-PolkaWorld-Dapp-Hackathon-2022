# Acala x PolkaWorld Dapp Hackathon 2022

## Application üéØ

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Acala-EVM-Dapps/Acala-PolkaWorld-Dapp-Hackathon-2022/fork) this repository.
2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template folder (`applications/application-template-project/`)in the `applications` folder. If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new folder and copy the contents of the template folder inside the new folder. Make sure you do not modify the template files directly.
3. Name the new folder after your project: project_name/.
4. In your newly created project folder, upload your project full source code for review. (It is allowed to not upload the project code when submitting the application for the first time, and upload it multiple times in the future).
5. In the `README.md` file of the newly created project folder, fill in the project information (First submission is allowed to fill in [TODO]). The more complete the information you provide, the more certain our attitude towards the project team will be. The template for providing information: [applications/application-template-project/README.md](https://github.com/Acala-EVM-Dapps/Acala-PolkaWorld-Dapp-Hackathon-2022/blob/main/applications/application-template-project/README.md)
6. Once done, create a pull request. Pull requests should only have files under a new folder - the new project folder you created from the template.
